# Hi

What happens when you give high schoolers 20 minutes, a bunch of esoteric
Wikipedia clippings, and 36 tubs of play-doh?

They mold together new kinds of visualizations!

Carnegie Mellon's first
<a href="https://cmusplash.learningu.org/">SPLASH</a> was in February 2020. SPLASH is a unique event hosted at many R1 schools across the
country that exposes high schoolers to campus and college-level topics
taught by undergrads.

My course was on visual thinking in abstract domains. I was particularly
inspired by Bruno Latour's essay from the 80's, Visualization and
Cognition.:
